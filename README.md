# Tire-Choice-Conjoint-Analysis
The data set has 18 profiles (combinations of tire features) along with customers ranking scores. The aim of the analysis was to ascertain which tire features were of much relevance to customers. 
From Figures 1 and 3, it can be observed that tire price was of much importance to Customer 1, whereas tire life was rather important to Customer 3. As shown in Figure 2, Customer 1 leaned towards the low-price ($69.99) tires regardless. Conversely, Customer 3 thought the longer (70,000 miles) the tire can go, the better it is for them. 
Tire hazard was the least concern for both customers, followed by brand. The differences in their rankings on these two features only varied slightly.
